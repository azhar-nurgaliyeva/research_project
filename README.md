### Research Project - "Inferring graph signal for network science"

## Preparations

Packages required are stated in the requirements.txt file. (Generate later)

All PyTorch dependencies can be installed using the following link: https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notes/installation.html#installation-via-binaries

Some of the .inp datasets are taken from water_networks folder from here: https://github.com/BME-SmartLab/GraphConvWat

The rest is all from BattLeDIM dataset.
